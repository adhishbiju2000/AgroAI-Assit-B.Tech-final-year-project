# AgroAI Assist

#### AgroAI Assist: CNN-Based Leaf Disease Detection with Real-Time Weather Alerts and Multilingual Chatbot Support for Farmers in India *B.Tech Major Project | Published in Vesper Journal (Scopus Indexed)*  

## Introduction

Agriculture faces major challenges including delayed disease detection, unpredictable weather patterns, and limited expert availability—especially in rural regions. These issues cause severe crop losses and financial instability for farmers.

**AgroAI Assist** addresses these challenges by integrating:  
- **AI-powered disease detection** (EfficientNet CNN)  
- **Real-time weather forecasting**  
- **Multilingual AI chatbot**  
- **Farmer-friendly dashboard**  

This makes advanced agricultural intelligence accessible to farmers, promoting early intervention and improved crop management.

## Project Overview 
AgroAI Assist is an AI-driven agricultural support system that enables farmers to:  
- Detect potato leaf diseases using **EfficientNet CNN**  
- Access **real-time weather insights**  
- Communicate with a **multilingual AI chatbot**  
- Make informed farming decisions through a simple web interface  

The system bridges the gap between **advanced AI research** and **practical agricultural needs**, making precision farming more accessible to rural users.
